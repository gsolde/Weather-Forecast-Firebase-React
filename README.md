# Iomed coding assignment

## - App Architecture - ##

The main objective was having a common place where data from the API could be fetched & stored, where backend errors could be handled and where every component had the ability to modify the stored data, to access it, and most importantly be subscribed to any change on it.

I chose to use the template provided by the redux-toolkit version of create-react-app because it provides all the boilerplate and dependencies needed to deal with the given project needs, and because it includes useful APIs like configureStore(), createSlice() and createAsyncThunk, which are very helpful to speed up the coding process and to structure the code.

Create-react-app comes in handy as well to develop small & medium-sized projects that do not need custom configuration. Being honest is imoprtant to me, so I will say as well that I am no erudite of either webpack or babel, so I decided to use this option because it is the fastest although I understand it can be far from being optimal in more complex scenarios.

## - Comments - ##

I could not add any graph to the app because I have been quite busy lately and I did not have the time.
I kept the UI as simple as possible and there are lots of extra features that can be added. 
The app is not responsive and there is no testing.

## - To run the app -
 
**1. Fork or clone the repo.**<br/>
**2. Install dependencies.**

  Run ```yarn install``` in the project folder
  
**3. You're ready to go!**

  Run ```npm run dev``` in the project directory to start the app in development mode.<br />
  
## - Deployed app -

Have a look at the project at https://iomed-coding-challenge.herokuapp.com/

## - Extra words -

If there is anything else you need me to add, modify or clarify please let me know.
Thanks so much for your time and have a nice day.

Best, <br/>
Gerard.
